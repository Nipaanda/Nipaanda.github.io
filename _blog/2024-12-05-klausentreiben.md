There is this very interesting tradition in my city as well the surrounding villages. 
<br>
<br>
We have these young men dress up in furs and horns with cow bells as sort of a signal to evil spirits that there are already spirits here, in hopes that they leave. <br>
They have rods, made from twigs or sticks to swing at people; usually teenagers, since they are more likely to taunt them. I think it's to drive the idea of emulating evil spirits even further. <br>
The figures are called "Klausen" and the custom is called "Klausentreiben".
<br>
<br>
Some regions in Austria have something similar called "Krampustreiben", but I feel like their version is much more terrifying.
<br>
<br>
This happens every year on the 5th and 6th of December (6th is St. Nicholas Day). On December 4th, young unmarried women dress up as witches, "BÃ¤rbele", and do something similar. As far as I know that is however meant as a good luck ritual for them to find a partner. You can see both of them in the picture above.

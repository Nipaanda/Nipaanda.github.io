I think I'm slowly figuring the camera stuff out.
<br>
Not with the Blue Tit or the Eurasian Coot, clearly. They are way too noisy.
<br>
But the ducks look decent.
<br>
The swans were messing with me. At first they were in front of me, but due to how the river is flowing I wasn't able to just run ahead and wait there. 
The river is doing a -| thing and I was in the bottom left.
So I sped all the way left, glimpsed over the tall bridge railing to see if they came my way - they did - and then I went over the bridge and from there half slid, half climbed down a slope. 
It's not totally straight, so I waited there for a bit for them to arrive. They didn't. I climbed back up and when I was there almost slipped really hard since it was still below freezing, but managed to catch myself.
Now I was curious were they went, so I went back right (now in the top left quadrant). They just turned around and went all the way back... I should've just waited, man.

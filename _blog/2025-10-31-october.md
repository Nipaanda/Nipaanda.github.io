info: return of the birds

This month has been all over the place.
<br>
<small>(Also this probably won't be a monthly thing)</small>
<br>
<br>
My dad informed me that my grandpa has died. Attending the funeral was way harder than expected, despite not having seen him in 10 years.
<br>
Seeing the condition my grandma is in was also shocking. Though maybe it serves as a catalyst to get more in contact with that part of my family again.
<br>
<br>
The leaves are turning brown and the snow keeps crawling lower and lower, so odds are this is the last month where I can walk around and explore a lot for this year.

This instrument is called Alphorn - can be very loud.

Very happy to see that the birds are returning. 🥹

And I got hunted by cows.

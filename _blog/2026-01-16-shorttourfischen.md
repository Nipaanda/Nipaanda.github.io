First off, not sure if I'm gonna do a post to summarize 2025. 
<br>
A bunch of stuff happened that I'd like to archive, but I don't feel motivated at the moment. 🫠
<br>
<br>
Since my grandpa's funeral last autumn I've started talking (more) to and visiting my dad again. 
<br>
Since he's also into photography on January 16th we went on a short walk to take some photos in Fischen (very close to the squirrel forest from earlier posts).
<br>
<br>
We found a lot of ducks, swans, and other birds. My dad saw his first Kingfisher (very pretty blue bird) - he got a decent photo of it, and I got a nice picture of some branches with a blob.
<br>
<small>(On purpose so he wouldn't feel bad that I saw one on my first real outing of course. 😶‍🌫️)</small>
<br>
<br>
It was fun; hope we'll be able to do it again soon when I have more time.

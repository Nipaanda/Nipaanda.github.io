Another mountain, but this time one that is actually really tall

The view is soo beautiful though. And I really like the picture of the cow with the mouth wide open, looks really goofy.

For food I had the worst curry imaginable - tasted like curry flavored water with chickpeas and green beans floating around. 🤢

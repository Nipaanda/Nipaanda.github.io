On this Saturday we went to the Freibergsee in Oberstdorf. You might have heard of the place if you follow winter sports? Anyway, there is this ski flying ramp thingy, where people on skis sit way up high, build up speed and then "jump" or rather fly ridiculously long distances. In this case more than 200 meters. <br>
<br>
Since this was the first time I was confident enough to bring my camera out, the photos aren't... perfect. <br>
For one I brought the wrong lens, so I couldn't really take scenic pictures that weren't zoomed in. So those ones I still had to take with my phone. <br>
And then I also forgot to up the maximum ISO, which is why a lot of pictures came out too dark. However, that I could partly remedy with editing(?). <br>

There is this very interesting tradition in my city as well the surrounding villages. 
<br />
<br />
We have these young men dress up in furs and horns with cow bells as sort of a signal to evil spirits that there are already spirits here, in hopes that they leave. <br />
They have rods, made from twigs or sticks to swing at people; usually teenagers, since they are more likely to taunt them. I think it’s to drive the idea of emulating evil spirits even further. <br />
The figures are called “Klausen” and the custom is called “Klausentreiben”.
<br />
<br />
Some regions in Austria have something similar called “Krampustreiben”, but I feel like their version is much more terrifying.
<br />
<br />
This happens every year on the 5th and 6th of December (6th is St. Nicholas Day). On December 4th, young unmarried women dress up as witches, “Bärbele”, and do something similar. As far as I know that is however meant as a good luck ritual for them to find a partner. You can see both of them in the picture above.
